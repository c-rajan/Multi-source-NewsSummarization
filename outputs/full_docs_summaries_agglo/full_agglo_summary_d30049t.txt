Administration officials say Perry is being asked to study ways to salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had been among the administration's proudest achievements in foreign policy. Kim said he asked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier this week and was suspicious of its answer. ``It was not sufficient or sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to hide the truth,'' Kim said in a seven-page press release. ``North Korea would be able to make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every year after that.'' It has offered to open the facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay compensation if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use.
