Police in northeast India fired tear gas into protesters on Wednesday, as clashes escalated over a controversial citizenship bill passed by parliament.
The legislation, which the Indian president is expected to sign this week, would fast track citizenship for scores of immigrants living in the country â€” but not Muslims.
On Twitter, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which would create a citizenship pathway based on religion.
Immigrants who came to the country from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh before 2015 and who belong to one of South Asia's major faiths, would be eligible. Islam is not included.
"A landmark day for India and our nation's ethos of compassion and brotherhood," Modi wrote.
"This Bill will alleviate the suffering of many who faced persecution for years."
Modi and his nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have made the legislation a top priority.
"We have to distinguish between the infiltrators and genuine persecuted refugees," said Sudhanshu Trivedi, a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
"This is the right time for India to assert its security concerns, because we are living with neighbors which are the biggest security threats in the entire world."
