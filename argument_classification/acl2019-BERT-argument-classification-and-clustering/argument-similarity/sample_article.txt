Two students, aged 16 and 14, have been killed and three others injured by a gunman who opened fire at a secondary school in California, officials say.
The victims died in a brief, 16-second gun attack shortly before classes began on Thursday at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles.
The attack came on the 16th birthday of the suspect, named by US media as fellow student, Nathaniel Berhow.
The suspect then shot himself in the head and died several hours later.
